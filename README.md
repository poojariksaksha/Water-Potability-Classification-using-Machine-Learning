#  Water Potability Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to classify water samples as **potable (safe to drink)** or **non-potable**, based on various **physico-chemical properties**. With rising water pollution, the need for scalable and intelligent water testing solutions has become critical. Our hybrid approach combining **Random Forest** and **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** demonstrates a strong ability to predict water potability, providing essential tools for policymakers and water management authorities.

## üß† Overview

Access to safe drinking water is a global concern. Traditional water testing methods are often expensive and slow. We offer a **data-driven solution** using machine learning to classify water samples based on features like pH, hardness, solids, and chloramines. This can help identify unsafe water sources and prioritize treatment strategies.

## üìä Dataset

- **Samples:** 3,276 water samples
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
- **Target Variable:** `Potability` (1 = potable, 0 = non-potable)
- **Missing Values:** Treated using **median imputation**
